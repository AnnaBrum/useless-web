# Code Review

What a perfectly useless website!

1. `script.js:16-19` - These could probably be `const` instead of `let` since they don't change.
2. `script.js:32-35` - Nice random calculation, but the for loop might be unnecessary since it overwrites the value each iteration and will get the last value everytime?
3. `script.js:40` - A parameter is declared but is never read.
4. `style.css:51-66` - These two animations have the same name.
5. `index.html:3-14` - You're missing a link to a favicon, so you get an error in the console.
